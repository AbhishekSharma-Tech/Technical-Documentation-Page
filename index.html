                Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, 
                which was later acquired by the Oracle Corporation, that provides a system for developing application 
                software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment. Java is used in a wide variety of 
                computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers. 
                Java applets, which are less common than standalone Java applications, were commonly run in secure, 
                sandboxed environments to provide many features of native applications through being embedded in HTML pages.

            Variables are containers for storing data values.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes</li>
              <li>int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123</li>
              <li>float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99</li>
              <li>char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes</li>
              <li>boolean - stores values with two states: true or false</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
          <header>Declaring variables</header>
          <article>
            <p>
                To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:
                <code>type variable = value;</code> 
                Where type is one of Java's types (such as int or String), and variable is the name of the variable (such as x or name). 
                The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.
            </p>
            <p>
                To create a variable that should store text, look at the following example: 
                <code>String name = "John";
                    System.out.println(name);</code> 
                    This create a variable called name of type String and assign it the value "John".
            </p>
            <p>
                However, you can add the final keyword if you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite 
                existing values (this will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):
            </p>
            <p>
                A demonstration of how to declare variables of other types:
                <code>int myNum = 5;
                    float myFloatNum = 5.99f;
                    char myLetter = 'D';
                    boolean myBool = true;
                    String myText = "Hello";</code> 
            </p>
          </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
          <header>Data Types</header>
          <article>
            <p>
                As explained in the previous chapter, a variable in Java must be a specified data type:
            </p>
            <code>int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)
                float myFloatNum = 5.99f;    // Floating point number
                char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
                boolean myBool = true;       // Boolean
                String myText = "Hello";     // String</code>
            <p>
                Data types are divided into two groups:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char.</li>
                <li>Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes.</li>
            </ul>
          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Type_Casting">
          <header>Type Casting</header>
          <article>
            <p>
                Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.
            </p>      
            <p>
                In Java, there are two types of casting:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Widening Casting</strong> (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
                    byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double</li>
                <li><strong>Narrowing Casting</strong> (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
                    double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte</li>
            </ul>
          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Booleans">
          <header>Booleans</header>
          <article>
            <p>
                A boolean type is declared with the boolean keyword and can only take the values true or false:
            </p>     
            <code>boolean isJavaFun = true;
                boolean isFishTasty = false;
                System.out.println(isJavaFun);     // Outputs true
                System.out.println(isFishTasty);   // Outputs false</code>
            <p>
                However, it is more common to return boolean values from boolean expressions, for conditional testing.
            </p>
      
            <p>
                A <strong>Boolean expression</strong> is a Java expression that returns a Boolean value: true or false.
            </p>
      
            <p>
                You can use a comparison operator, such as the greater than (>) operator to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true:
            </p>      
            <code>int x = 10;
                int y = 9;
                System.out.println(x > y); // returns true, because 10 is higher than 9
            </code>

          <header>If..Else Statement</header>
          <article>
            Java has the following conditional statements:
            <ul>
                <li>Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true</li>
                <li>Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false</li>
                <li>Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false</li>
                <li>Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Use the if statement to specify a block of Java code to be executed if a condition is true.</p>      
            <code>if (condition) {
                // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
              }</code>
              Note that if is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (If or IF) will generate an error.
            <p>
                Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
            </p>
            <code>if (condition) {
                // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
              } else {
                // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
              } 
            </code>
            Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.
            <code
              >if (condition1) {
                // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
              } else if (condition2) {
                // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
              } else {
                // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
              }</code>
          </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="While_Loop">
          <header>While Loop</header>
          <article>
            Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.
            <p>Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.</p>

            The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:
            <code>while (condition) {
                // code block to be executed
              }</code> 
      
            <p>
                The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, 
                before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
            </p>      
            <code>do {
                // code block to be executed
              }
              while (condition);</code>
            <p>
                The example below uses a do/while loop. The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the 
                condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:
            </p>
            <code>int i = 0;
                do {
                  System.out.println(i);
                  i++;
                }
                while (i < 5);</code>
          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="For_Loop">
          <header>For Loop</header>
          <article>
            When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop:
            <code>for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
                // code block to be executed
              }</code>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Statement 1</strong> is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Statement 2</strong> defines the condition for executing the code block.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Statement 3</strong> is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The example below will print the numbers 0 to 4:
            </p>
      
            <code>for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println(i);
              }</code>
            <p>
                <h4>Example explained</h6>
                <p>Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (int i = 0).</p>                
                <p>Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5). If the condition is true, the loop will start over again, if it is false, the loop will end.</p>                
                <p>Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also a "for-each" loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array:
            </p>
            <code>for (type variableName : arrayName) {
                // code block to be executed
              }</code>
